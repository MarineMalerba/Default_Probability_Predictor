# Default_Probability_Predictor
This repository contains two Python scripts designed for loan default prediction and FICO score bucketing optimization.

## Probability of Default Predictive Model Using Logistic Regression ##
This script uses logistic regression to predict the probability of default based on various borrower features.

## Dynamic FICO Score Bucketing Optimization Based On Log-Likelihood ##
This script uses dynamic programming to optimize bucket boundaries for FICO scores and maximize the log-likelihood of default predictions.
Displays optimal bucket boundaries and average probability of default for each of them.
